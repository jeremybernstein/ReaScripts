  # Layered child windows required for improved performance while running MIDI Razor Edits on all platforms
  The method used by MIDI Razor Edits to draw into the MIDI Editor (the same method
  used by Julian Sader's scripts like MultiTool) has terrible performance problems
  on Windows. These do not arise on macOS or Linux, but there are good reasons to put the
  overlay and drawing into an extension under my control.

  The "childwindow" extension provides a composited, layered child window which floats above the
  MIDI Editor and performs fast, flicker-free drawing for the MIDI Razor Edits script.
  if you are using MIDI Razor Edits, please install it.
